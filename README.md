# AutoClicker V2.0
Skrift presents itself as a user-friendly auto-clicker. While it lacks a traditional user interface, it employs a straightforward "click-and-go" mechanism. Activating it requires just a single key press, typically F6, and utilizing it involves pressing the mouse button. Remarkably, Skrift can achieve speeds of up to one thousand clicks per minute (CPM).
